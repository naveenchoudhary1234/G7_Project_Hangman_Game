INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE GAME

Start the Game: Run the Python script containing the Hangman game code in your Python environment.

Game Setup: Upon starting the game, you'll see the title "|H_A_N_G_M_A_N|" displayed.

Game Display: The game will display a blank space representing the secret word, the hangman drawing (initially empty), and any missed letters.

Guessing Letters: The game will prompt you to guess a letter. Enter a single letter from the English alphabet (a-z) and press enter.

Correct Guesses: If your guessed letter is correct and is part of the secret word, it will be revealed in its correct position(s) in the word.

Incorrect Guesses: If your guessed letter is incorrect, it will be added to the list of missed letters, and a part of the hangman drawing will be drawn.

Winning the Game: Continue guessing letters until you either successfully uncover all the letters in the secret word or until the hangman drawing is complete. If you reveal all the letters before completing the hangman drawing, you win the game.

Losing the Game: If you make too many incorrect guesses and the hangman drawing is completed before you guess all the letters in the secret word, you lose the game.

End of Game: Once the game is over (either by winning or losing), you will be prompted to play again. Type "Yes" or "No" to indicate whether you want to play another round.

Enjoy: Have fun playing the Hangman game and try to guess as many words correctly as you can!
